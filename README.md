# neural network from scratch

In this repo I try to implement a basic image classification algorithm using my limited knowledge of ML and 3Blue1Brown's youtube series (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) and a few links from it's video descriptions.


# Data Set 

I will be using the MNIST data set linked here (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)


# "from scratch" disclaimer. 

I do not intend implement things closely related to ML like matrix multiplication. I value my time.
